# Night App
Imagine if you could use Microsoft Word or others text editors in a dark mode? No, not just parts of the interface, but the sheet where you write. This is the objective of this project!

I hope you enjoy it! :)

Update: since I started this project, Microsoft finally released the dark mode feature to Microsoft Word. Anyway, I will keep working in this project, in order to just create a simple rich text editor with more features than Quill offer. 

### What is this project?
A text editor inspired on VS Code and others technology editors, designed to corporate workers out of tech. 

### What does the project looks like?
Because the project is still begining, I do not have an Loom video yet. :)

### What was my motivation?
I worked for more than ten years in corporate offices - I was lawyer - and, as in technology, these workers spend the hold day in front of a computer screen, most of the times using text editors. However, unlike in technology, these people does not work with a dark screen, being exposed all day to the bright light of an document page with a #fff background.

With this project, I intend to help these people!

### Why did I build this project?
To garauntee more life quality to corporate workers, that today are daily exposed to a bright lights on the computer for several hours.

### What problem does it solve?
When we use an dark mode text editor, we save energy (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2021/07/31/phone-battery-life-dark-mode/) and reduces the exposal of worker's eye to blue light, which is harmful to the health (https://www.healthline.com/health/is-dark-mode-better-for-your-eyes#benefits-of-dark-mode). 

Update: right now the problem is already solved.

### What did I learn?
Right now, the 'inovation' on my projects is the use of styled components. 

### Future plans
As the problem is solved, I intend to create some features that Quill does not provide nowadays.
